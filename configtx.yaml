#   CAPABILITIES
#
#   This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

        # should leave this flag set to true.
        V1_1: true

#   PROFILES
#
#   Different configuration profiles may be encoded here to be specified as
#   parameters to the configtxgen tool. The profiles which specify consortiums
#   are to be used for generating the orderer genesis block. With the correct
#   consortium members defined in the orderer genesis block, channel creation
#   requests may be generated with only the org member names and a consortium
#   name.
